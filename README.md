# SourceCred Example Instance

This repository will contain an example SourceCred instance.

New users of SourceCred are encouraged to fork this repo to start their own
instance.

# About SourceCred Instances

SourceCred is organized around "instances". Every instance must have a
`sourcecred.json` file at root, which specifies which plugins are active in the
instance.

Each instance has the following directory structure:
- `config/` stores user-defined configuration.
- `config/plugins/$PLUGIN_OWNER/$PLUGIN_NAME` stores plugin-specific data. Each
  plugin has its own directory.
- `cache/` stores intermediate produced by the plugins. This directory should
  not be checked into Git.
- `output/` stores output data generated by SourceCred, including the Cred
  Graph and the Cred Scores. This directory should be checked into Git; when
  needed, it may be removed and re-generated by SourceCred.
- `site/` which stores the compiled SourceCred frontend, which can display data
  stored in the instance.

The instance is updated via the following commands:
- `sourcecred load [...plugins]` loads the cache. By default it loads all
  plugins, or it can load only specific plugins if requested.
- `sourcecred graph [...plugins]` regenerates plugin graphs from the cache;
  these graphs are saved in `output/`
- `sourcecred score` computes Cred scores, combining data from all the chosen
  plugins
- `sourcecred site` re-compiles the SourceCred frontend

# Supported Plugins

## GitHub

The GitHub plugin loads GitHub repositories.

You can specify the repositories to load in
`config/plugins/sourcecred/github/config.json`. In order to load the GitHub
plugin, you must have a GitHub API key in your environment as
`$SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN`. The key should be read-only without any special
permissions (unless you are loading a private GitHub repository, in which case
the key needs access to your private repositories).

You can generate a GitHub API key [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## Discourse

The Discourse plugin loads Discourse fourms; currently, only one forum may be loaded in any single instance. This does not require any special API
keys or permissions. You just need to set the server url in `config/plugins/sourcecred/discourse/config.json`.

## Discord

The Discord plugin loads Discord servers, and mints cred on Discord reactions.

To get this setup, you'll first want to enable Developer Mode in your Discord
client, under User Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced -> Developer Mode. This
will give you the ability to right-click on items and copy their Discord ids.

Then, right click on the server you want to track, and copy its ID. Modify the
`config/plugins/sourcecred/discord/config.json` file to have the correct
guildId.

Next, you'll need to create a Discord application and add it to the server. (This requires admin permissions on that server.)

The first step is to create an application, which you can do here:
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications

You'll get an application client ID, which you'll need in a future step.

Next, give that application a Bot, by click on the "Bot" menu option on the left, and then adding a bot.
The bot will have a token, which you should also save.

Once you've made the bot, you need to invite it to your server.
You'll need to do so by constructing a url like:

`https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&scope=bot&permissions=66560`

Where `${CLIENT_ID}` should be replaced with your application's client id from
above. For example, if your application's client id is 1234, use the following url:

`https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234&scope=bot&permissions=66560`

Open that url in a browswer where you are logged into Discord, and you'll see a
menu letting you add the bot to servers you have access to. Add it to the
server in question, giving it permission to read messages and read message
history.

Then, set the bot's token to the environment variable `$SOURCECRED_DISCORD_TOKEN`.

You can now load your Discord server. Hooray!

As an added bit of configuration, you can set custom reactionWeights in the
`reactionWeights` section of the Discord config. These allow you to change how
much Cred is minted per reaction.

If you want to change the weight for a default reaction, just put the
reaction's literal emoji in the config.json, as in `"ðŸ’œ": 5` to give the purple
heart a weight of 5.

If you want to set a custom weight for a custom emoji, you'll need to get the
custom emoji's server id. You can do this by right-clicking on a custom emoji
in the server, and clicking "copy link". This will give you a link to the
emoji's image on Discord's servers, for example:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/678399364418502669.png?v=1

The numeric substring is the emoji's ID. You can then specify it in the
reaction weights file as `$EMOJI_NAME:$EMOJI_ID`, as in:
`"sourcecred:678399364418502669": 10` to give some server's custom SourceCred
emoji a weight of 10.

# Removing plugins

To deactivate a plugin, just remove it from the `bundledPlugins` array in the `sourcecred.json` file.
You can also remove its `config/plugins/OWNER/NAME` directory for good measure.

# Forking off this instance

Using this instance as a starting point, you can update the config to include
just the plugins you want, pointing at the data you care about.

Get [Yarn] and then run `yarn` to install SourceCred and dependencies.

Then, run the following commands to update the instance:

- `yarn load`
- `yarn graph`
- `yarn score`

If you want to update the frontend, you can do so via:

- `yarn site`

# Publishing on GitHub pages

Once you've got the instance configured to your satisfaction, you can publish
it on GitHub pages by opening the repository settings, scrolling to GitHub
pages, and selecting to publish from the master branch.
